# Zomato Dataset Analysis using SQL

I was working on the following while using SQL to explore data:...

checked every aspect of the table, including the data types, constraints, and column names.
duplicate entries in the [RestaurantId] field were examined.

Deleted unnecessary columns from the table
Two separate tables were merged, and a new column called Country_Name was introduced using the primary key [CountryCode]. column
found the misspelled city names and fixed them
Using Windows capabilities, the number of restaurants was counted by rolling or moving count.
checked the rating, currency column, and votes, max, and average data.
Added a new rating category column.
